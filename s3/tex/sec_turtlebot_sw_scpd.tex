\section{The Turtlebot Software}
Most of the forward-facing Turtlebot software you will work with is located in the \texttt{asl\_turtlebot} repository on Github. To get it, go to \texttt{\textasciitilde/catkin\_ws/src} and run:

\begin{lstlisting}
git clone https://github.com/StanfordASL/asl_turtlebot.git
\end{lstlisting}

Since we downloaded a new catkin package, we need to rebuild the workspace by running the following from the \texttt{\textasciitilde/catkin\_ws} directory.

\begin{lstlisting}
catkin_make
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Turtlebot bring up}
Once logged in to Genbu, start roscore:

\begin{lstlisting}
roscore -p $ROS_PORT
\end{lstlisting}

In a new terminal window, run the Gazebo environment:

\begin{lstlisting}
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
\end{lstlisting}

{\bf Problem 1: Once this is all running, which rostopics are available? Paste this list in your submission.}
